<h1 class="caption1">Overview</h1>
<p class="proposal">Nowadays, magazines and newspapers are no longer the first way for us to get information. Perhaps one day e-books or anything digital will completely replace paper products. Print is gradually dying, and we are now feeling that change, seeing world moving from the print industry to the digital world. I, in this book, want to explore the difference between design on web and design on paper. By comparing typography, layout, color schemes, and user interaction, I will provide viewers with an in-depth understanding of how digital technologies have transformed the design process and the user experience. This exploration is not just about design; it's a visual journey that highlights the ever-evolving world of media and design, with an eye toward the future. As print gives way to pixels, this book seeks to inspire designers with fresh perspectives on the changing landscape of design.</p>
